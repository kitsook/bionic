"""
This module contains functions which are used to find references in
your code objects. `get_referenced_objects` function finds those
references for you given a code object and an additional `CodeContext`
input, which can be extracted using the `get_code_context` function.

CodeHasher uses these methods as part of hashing an entity function for
Bionic cache invalidation. Using these methods, CodeHasher can hash the
references of entity functions (and even their references), so that any
change in the references are also detected by Bionic to invalidate
cache.

def get_referenced_objects(code, context):
    """
    Returns referenced objects for a code object and name of the references when
    the references cannot be detected without performing runtime logic.

    Referenced objects can be anything from a class, a function, a module or any
    variables. The references can also be any scope, like global, local, cell,
    free, or can even be in another object referenced using a full qualified
    name.

    Note that this function does not perform any runtime logic. This includes
    calling any functions used by the input code because doing so can be
    expensive and have unintended consequences. Due to this, any references with
    a fully qualified name that uses result of such a call won't be detected.
    This means that if an inner function returns a module or a class, any
    variables of the module or the class won't be detected. In this case, we will
    return the name of the reference as a proxy. So for a function like below,
    the returned reference would be ``"call"`` instead of ``MyClass.call``.

    .. code-block:: python

        def x():
            my_cls = get_my_class("MyClass") # Returns class MyClass
            my_cls.call()


    On a higher level, this leaves out some changes that Bionic won't be able to
    auto-detect for caching. Bionic should be able to detect any changes except
    when a function returns a class or a module. In those case, Bionic cannot
    detect what is returned. But it should be able to detect the class / module
    returned when hashing the function which returns the said result. Bionic will
    still hash those classes / modules, and detect as many changes as it can in
    them.
